(STATE of SAN FRANCISCO ) 

DATASET LINK: https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783

Worked on Police Department Incident Reports: San Francisco public dataset of incidents reported between 1st Jan 2018 to March 2023. It includes information on the type and location of incidents, as well as the date and time they occurred along with the the time they are reported. 

I did analysis to determine:

1. What is the relationship between crime rates and socio-economic factors such as income, education, and employment rates in San Francisco? (general scenario using yearly values)
2. What is the total number of reported crimes over the past 5 Years?
3. Which state has the highest number of reported crimes and which has the lowest?
4. What is the most common crime type reported in each neighborhood over the past 5 Years?
5. Are there any particular locations within each neighborhood where crime is more prevalent?
6. Is there a correlation between the latitude/longitude of each crime and the type of crime committed?
7. What is the percentage of cases in which an outcome has been determined overall?
8. Is there any variation in the distribution of crime types across different parts of each neighborhood?
9. Drawing Demographics and finding any relevance thru correlation matrix.
